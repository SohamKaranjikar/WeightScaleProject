For our project we will be making the software for controlling a digital
bathroom scale.

We will be making hardware modifications to an ordinary digital bathroom scale,
removing some of the internal electronics and replacing them with a soldered
connection to an external processor, such as a Raspberry Pi or
Arduino. Depending on what we expect to be easiest with the particular scale we
end up using, the new controller will either be reading raw data from the
scale's sensors or simply be reading the values that the original electronics
send to the display.

Since the scale will only be used for a few seconds each day, we will design our
controller such that the main processor is able to be turned completely off
while the scale is not in use. This will greatly reduce power usage, and
possibly even make it feasible to run the device off of battery power.
